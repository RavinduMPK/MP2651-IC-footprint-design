**Key Features:**

- Schematic Capture: Altium Designer enables the creation of detailed electronic schematics using an intuitive graphical interface.
- PCB Layout: Design complex PCB layouts with support for multi-layer designs, high-speed routing, and component placement.
- 3D Visualization: Visualize the PCB in a three-dimensional environment to identify potential design issues.
- Footprint Creation: Design custom footprints for components with precise dimensions, pads, and clearances.
- Symbol Creation: Generate symbols that represent electronic components in schematic diagrams.
- Design Rule Checking (DRC): Detect design rule violations to ensure the final PCB layout meets manufacturing requirements.
- Collaboration: Altium Designer offers features for collaborative design, allowing teams to work on projects simultaneously.
- Output Generation: Generate Gerber files, Bill of Materials (BOM), and other manufacturing documentation required for PCB fabrication and assembly.

By utilizing Altium Designer, I've created accurate and functional footprints and symbols for the IC in this repository, ensuring compatibility with industry standards and best practices in PCB design.
